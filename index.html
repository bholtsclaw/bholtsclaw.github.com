  <p>A very boring page for the moment, I've not taken the time to write the scripts to build this page automaticly yet. But I have plans to for the <a href="http://github.com/bholtsclaw">projects on My Github</a> Personal Account or that of my <a href="http://github.com/pixeldrop">Pixeldrop Orginisation</a> Account ( that solely consiting of me at the moment, lol ) built auto-magic-ly when the projects are updated, I'm guesing this will be a combo of github webhooks and a small PHP that will receive POST from the webhooks directly or via XMPP as I've not yet decided fully.</p>
  <p>Until then Here is a link to my slightly more asteticly pleasing that also has my contact information should you like a copy of it, as well as a download link at the bottom if you wish to save an offline PDF copy, already prepared for you to save.</p>
