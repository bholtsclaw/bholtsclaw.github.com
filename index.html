The following sections provide basic information about installing Ruby and RubyGems on Windows as well as Linux computers from a few vendors and 'How to Access and Update' Ruby and RubyGems on OS X 10.5+.</p>







54.247.179.184








----

===Ubuntu===

<p>Open up the 'Software Center' app from your launcher and type in `RubyGems` without quotes into the application search box at the 
top right, and press [enter]. RubyGems then can be installed by just clicking on the button labeled 'Install', thats it. Be sure to 
Follow any extra instructions from the Software Center should there be any during or after installation.</p>
''Alternatively you can install from a terminal as well, use the '''apt-get''' command-line tool to install Ruby and RubyGems, as shown below.''

* Install the full Ruby package and RubyGems: '''sudo apt-get install ruby-full rubygems'''
 - Consult your system administrator for any required authentication credentials for the '''sudo''' command that may required.

====Debian Linux====
* ''Same steps and options as Ubuntu above for the Alternative install method, or GUI Using '''Synaptic''' package manager instead of Software Center.''

===Mac OS X===
Mac's with version 10.5 Leopard or higher already have Ruby and RubyGems installed, Ruby and RubyGems update instructions are [http://homebrew.github.com|found here] at the Homebrew for OS X page, as well as instructions for adding Homebrew to your OS X machine if you do not already have it installed.

If you are using an earlier version of Mac OS like 10.3 or 10.4, try following any directions at <a href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">RubyGems</a> to see if your version is still supported officially or not, plus there many community workarounds and tips for those wishing to still make use of OS X or Pure Darwin sometimes registers here too on older machines or newer machines both.

Test to ensure that the '''gem'''command is in your path: '''$ which gem'''

If the command is not found, then update your '''PATH''' variable accordingly.  For example, you can update your '''.bashrc''' file with the following line:
'''export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin'''

===Windows===
Download and install <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org/" title="ruby installer for windows">Ruby Installer for Windows</a>. The installer already includes RubyGems.

Be sure you use the Ruby-enabled command prompt window when you later install and use '''vmc'''.   You access this command prompt from the Windows Start menu (<strong>All Programs &gt; Ruby &lt;version&gt; &gt; Start Command Prompt with Ruby</strong>).

Finally, update RubyGems from the Ruby Command Prompt:

<pre>'''prompt&gt; gem update --system
'''</pre>

===RedHat Linux===

<p>From a terminal, use the '''yum''' command-line tool to install Ruby and RubyGems, as shown below.</p>

<ol>
* 
    <p>Install Ruby:</p>

    <p>'''sudo yum install ruby'''
  
  * 
    <p>If you are using RedHat Enterprise Linux 6, enable the <em>Optional</em> channel for your host by logging into <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/">Red Hat Network (RHN)</a>.</p>
  
  * 
    <p>Install RubyGems:</p>

    <p>'''sudo yum install rubygems'''
  
</ol>
===SuSE Linux===

<p>From a terminal, use the '''yast''' command-line tool to install Ruby and RubyGems, as shown below.</p>

<ol>
* 
    <p>Install Ruby:</p>

    <p>'''yast -i ruby'''
  
  * 
    <p>Install RubyGems:</p>

    <p>'''yast -i rubygems'''
  
</ol>
