  <p>The Ubuntu Community Council is the primary community (i.e. non-technical) governance body for the Ubuntu Project and as such has an important role and responsibility to the Ubuntu community.</p>
  <p>The Community Council advises and decides on community policy and process. It is also an escalation body for incidents that occur elsewhere in the Ubuntu community.</p>
  <p>Members of the Community Council have demonstrated a strong commitment and participation history in Ubuntu, clear leadership skills, and have the time and availability to commit to the needs of the council.</p>

    <h2>How to achieve this trophy</h2>
    <ol>
      <li class="icon-check">Become an Ubuntu Member. Demonstrate effective and extensive contribution to Ubuntu for a sustained period of time. There is no fixed time period, but this should be long enough to demonstrate your commitment to the project.</li>
      <li class="icon-check">Amend the wiki page that was created for Ubuntu Membership usually found on <tt>wiki.ubuntu.com</tt> that is up todate and outlines your contributions. In the wiki page include your contributions, describe which teams you are in, and summarize your efforts.</li>
      <li class="icon-check">When the next Community Council election is announced, nominate yourself as a candidate. Mark Shuttleworth, the Founder of Ubuntu, and also known as sabdfl (self-appointed bebevolent dictator for life) selects the canidates from the list of nominees and puts those forward to be voted on by current Ubuntu Members.</li>

      <h2>Tips and Tricks:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="icon-ok">Focus on your leadership abilities. The Community Council is an important leadership position and we look for strong, capable, confident leaders.</li>
        <li class="icon-ok">You should probably have led another team to develop and demonstrate your leadership capabilities before applying to be on the Community Council.</li>
        <li class="icon-ok">Only apply to the Community Council when you have had a significant amount of experience in the community.</li>

      <h2>Pitfalls To Avoid:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="icon-remove">Don't apply to the Community Council just to be in a position of power.</li>
        <li class="icon-remove">Try not to be on more than one council (e.g. Community Council, Technical Board) at the same time. Join one, and give it your full attention.</li>
